# Unilabs

Welcome to the Unilabs test project!
Implementation of tests described on README.md

## Overview

Brief description of the project, its purpose, and main features.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/unilabs.git
    cd unilabs
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install
    pandas
    sqlalchemy
    numpy
    ```

3. **Review the implementation:**
    
The project is organized into four Jupyter notebooks (1–4), each corresponding to one part of the assignment.
All notebooks are designed to run end-to-end, producing results directly within the output cells.
For simplicity, the following tools were used:
Pandas → data extraction and transformations
SQLite with SQLAlchemy → database creation and SQL execution
Matplotlib → data visualizations
